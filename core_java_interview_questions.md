# Core Java Interview Questions & Answers

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Java Basics

### 1. What are the main features of Java?
- Object-Oriented  
- Platform Independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere)  
- Simple and Secure  
- Robust (memory management, exception handling)  
- Multithreaded  
- Portable  
- High Performance (with JIT compiler)  
- Distributed  

---

### 2. What is JVM, JDK, and JRE?
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** Executes Java bytecode, provides platform independence.  
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** Provides JVM + libraries to run Java programs.  
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger) ‚Üí used to develop Java applications.  

---

### 3. Explain the differences between JVM and JRE.
- **JVM**: Abstract machine that runs Java bytecode.  
- **JRE**: JVM + libraries + supporting files (runtime environment).  
üëâ JVM is part of JRE.  

---

### 4. What are wrapper classes in Java?
- Wrapper classes convert **primitive types** (int, char, etc.) into **objects**.  
- Example: `int ‚Üí Integer`, `char ‚Üí Character`.  
- Used in collections (because collections only store objects).  

---

### 5. Why is Java platform-independent?
- Java code is compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on **JVM**.  
- Since every OS has its own JVM, the same bytecode can run anywhere.  

---

### 6. Explain Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
- JIT is part of JVM.  
- Converts bytecode into **native machine code at runtime**.  
- Improves performance of Java applications.  

---

### 7. What is the difference between Java and C++?
- Java is **purely object-oriented** (except primitives), C++ is **object-oriented but allows procedural programming**.  
- Java is **platform-independent**, C++ is **platform-dependent**.  
- Java has **automatic memory management (Garbage Collector)**, C++ requires **manual memory management**.  
- Java does not support **multiple inheritance** (uses interfaces), C++ supports it.  

---

### 8. What are reserved keywords in Java?
- Keywords that are **predefined by Java** and cannot be used as identifiers.  
- Example: `class`, `public`, `static`, `void`, `int`, `new`, `return`.  
- Java has **53 reserved keywords** (since Java 17).  

---

### 9. What is bytecode?
- Intermediate code generated by the Java compiler (`.class` file).  
- Not machine-specific, runs on JVM.  
- Ensures portability across platforms.  

---

### 10. Explain main() method in Java.
- Entry point of every Java application.  
- Syntax:  
  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args)
  ```
- **public** ‚Üí accessible everywhere.  
- **static** ‚Üí JVM can call without creating an object.  
- **void** ‚Üí no return value.  
- **String[] args** ‚Üí command-line arguments.  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Types & Variables

### 1. What are the data types in Java?
Java has two categories of data types:  

**a) Primitive Data Types (8 types):**  
- byte (1 byte)  
- short (2 bytes)  
- int (4 bytes)  
- long (8 bytes)  
- float (4 bytes)  
- double (8 bytes)  
- char (2 bytes, Unicode)  
- boolean (1 bit, true/false)  

**b) Non-Primitive Data Types:**  
- String  
- Arrays  
- Classes  
- Interfaces  

---

### 2. Difference between primitive and non-primitive data types.

| Feature                | Primitive                        | Non-Primitive                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Basic built-in types             | Derived/Reference types         |
| **Size**                | Fixed                           | Can vary                       |
| **Stored in**           | Stack                           | Heap (reference stored in stack)|
| **Examples**            | int, char, boolean              | String, Array, Objects          |

---

### 3. What is type casting in Java?
Type casting is converting one data type into another.  
- Example:  
  ```java
  int x = 10;
  double y = (double) x;  // type casting int ‚Üí double
  ```

---

### 4. Difference between widening and narrowing type casting.

- **Widening (Implicit):**  
  Smaller data type ‚Üí Larger data type.  
  No data loss, done automatically.  
  Example: `int ‚Üí long ‚Üí float ‚Üí double`  

- **Narrowing (Explicit):**  
  Larger data type ‚Üí Smaller data type.  
  May cause data loss, requires explicit cast.  
  Example: `double ‚Üí float ‚Üí int ‚Üí byte`  

---

### 5. What is the default value of primitive data types?

| Data Type  | Default Value |
|------------|---------------|
| byte       | 0             |
| short      | 0             |
| int        | 0             |
| long       | 0L            |
| float      | 0.0f          |
| double     | 0.0d          |
| char       | '\u0000' (null char) |
| boolean    | false         |

---

### 6. Why is String not a primitive data type in Java?
- String is a **class** in `java.lang` package.  
- It provides many **methods (like length(), substring(), concat())** which primitive types do not.  
- Being an object allows Strings to be immutable and powerful.  
- Primitive types are stored in stack, but Strings are objects stored in heap.
